In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regards to object ownership and the intricacies of reference counting.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello, world!"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

This seems straightforward. However, if `someMethod` is called multiple times, or if `myString` is modified within other methods without proper handling, it could lead to retain cycles. Each time `self.myString` is set, the existing string (if any) is released, but the new string is retained by `MyClass`. This could inadvertently prevent the string from being deallocated, leading to memory leaks.
